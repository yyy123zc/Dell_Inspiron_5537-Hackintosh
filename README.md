## Installation

### PS: Its recommended to use external USB mouse during installation, with plugged in charger, 8GB+ USB drive is needed to make bootable usb, and if you are making dual boot, make sure your EFI partition is larger than 400mb+, 500~700mb is recommended 

### Set BIOS settings 
Press `F2` to load BIOS settings. Change the following settings:

- Disk: AHCI
- UEFI Boot: Enabled
- Secure Boot: Disabled
- Disable Intel Speedstep 

1. Make bootable usb from Olarila from [here](https://www.olarila.com/topic/5794-hackintosh-guide-install-macos-with-olarila-image-step-by-step-install-and-post-install-windows-or-mac)

2. Follow the instructions, use config2.plist for booting

3. Then after following intructions, instead of taking OpenCore folder from Olarila, use mine, you wont need to install OpenCore seperately 

4. Reboot 

5. Install these kexts to /System/Library/Extensions, you can use any kext installer app, but I recommend to do it with Kext Wizard, you can manually push to /System/Library/Extensions, then you might need to run this on terminal to rebuild kext caches, to do that run following command

sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions && sudo kextcache -u /

6. Reboot, everything should be as fine as it should be
